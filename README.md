# Sentiment_Analysis
This is my personal project where I conducted sentiment analysis on ~30000 Amazon reviews using sklearn python library and jupyter notebooks. In the project I trained a Logistic Regression model to make predictions. <br>
You can browse through my jupyter notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/calvinjohnshaji/sentiment-analysis-on-amazon-reviews). I have explained my work thoroughly there along with the code.
