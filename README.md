# Sentiment_Analysis
This is my personal project where I conducted **sentiment analysis** on ~30000 Amazon reviews using **sklearn python** library and **jupyter** notebooks. In the project I cleaned the text reviews using **regular expressions** and trained a **Logistic Regression** model to make predictions. <br><br>
You can browse through my jupyter notebook on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/calvinjohnshaji/sentiment-analysis-on-amazon-reviews). I have explained my work thoroughly there along with the code.
